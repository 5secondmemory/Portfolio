### Projects
### Project 1: Modeling House Prices Using Realtor Data [PDF here](https://github.com/Will-Munson/Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/The%20Determinants%20of%20House%20Pricing%20(2).pdf)

>In this project, we take a look into each factor that goes into the overall price of housing, using methods such as model selection, regression analysis, and residual analysis. All of the analysis was conducted using R. The box plot down below shows the prices of homes based on their proximity to local elementary schools in the area. <br/> Given house prices are higher near Edison Elementary, this must be a prestigious school in the area.

### Project 2: Air Quality in Marginalized Communities [PDF here](https://github.com/Will-Munson/Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Air%20Quality%20in%20Marginalized%20Communities%20(2).pdf), [Rmarkdown file here](https://github.com/Will-Munson/Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Code%20Samples/Air%20Quality%20and%20Marginalized%20Communities.Rmd)

>For this project, I used R to compare demographic information from NYU Fuhrman Center to air quality levels in each community district of New York City. The purpose of this project was to show that people living in marginalized communities (low income, struggling communities, etc.) are also living in areas that could potentially affect the communities health and wellbeing. <br/> The data was analyzed using various packages in R, including ggplot2, lubridate, and tidyverse. <br/> The density plot to the left shows the distribution of yearly PM2.5 measurements from each community district in the five boroughs. <br/> The graph on the right compares the PM2.5 levels with crime rate per capita in each district, separated by borough. Using a smoother line on each graph, we can see that districts with higher crime rates also tend to have higher air pollution rates.

### Project 3: Air Quality in Marginalized Communities - Philadelphia [PDF here](https://github.com/5secondmemory/Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Air%20Quality%20in%20Marginalized%20Communities%20-%20Philadelphia%20edition.pdf), [Rmarkdown file here](https://github.com/Will-Munson/Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Code%20Samples/Philadelphia%20Air%20Quality%20in%20Marginalized%20Communities.Rmd)

>This project takes a similar approach to the previous one, but in a different location, and with different demographic information. Using R, I observed the relationship between air quality and the wellbeing of residents different sections of Philadelphia, and the nearby suburbs. <br/> This residual plot shows how each district of Philadelphia differs from the normal amounts of fine particulate matter in the air, and the racial demographics of each district. <br/> The lowest set of points on the graph represent Southeast Philadelphia. As the graph shows, this is the only part of the city where the population is majority white, which is a potential indicator of racial bias.

### Project 4: Lake Mead Water Levels [PDF poster here](https://github.com/Will-Munson/Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Lake%20Mead%20Water%20Levels%20GIS%20poster.pdf)

>This poster illustrates the rapid decline of Lake Mead's water levels, and its impacts on the communities that depend on it. <br/> The visualizations in this poster were developed using ArcGIS. <br/> The graphic down below shows the decline of water levels in Overton Arm, in the northern portion of Lake Mead. By 2015, the water was at the light yellow portion of the map.
